# OneHandedErgodox
Trying to get an ergodox layout that will work well for one handed use (Right Hand first)


These file should be under QMKFirmware/ Keyboards/Ergodox Infinity/Keymaps
They are based on an existing keymap HalfKeyboard

I used a version of my CommonFunctions file, but I altered it so much trying to get it to compile, that it will be a lot of work to consolidate with the regular CommonFunctions file...
